## \-\-- Day 11: Reactor \-\--

You hear some loud beeping coming from a hatch in the floor of the
factory, so you decide to check it out. Inside, you find several large
electrical conduits and a ladder.

Climbing down the ladder, you discover the source of the
[beeping]{title="The beeping is unrelated to the issue with the server rack. The reactor is just hungry."}:
a large, toroidal reactor which powers the factory above. Some Elves
here are hurriedly running between the reactor and a nearby server rack,
apparently trying to fix something.

One of the Elves notices you and rushes over. \"It\'s a good thing
you\'re here! We just installed a new *server rack*, but we aren\'t
having any luck getting the reactor to communicate with it!\" You glance
around the room and see a tangle of cables and devices running from the
server rack to the reactor. She rushes off, returning a moment later
with a list of the devices and their outputs (your puzzle input).

For example:

    aaa: you hhh
    you: bbb ccc
    bbb: ddd eee
    ccc: ddd eee fff
    ddd: ggg
    eee: out
    fff: out
    ggg: out
    hhh: ccc fff iii
    iii: out

Each line gives the name of a device followed by a list of the devices
to which its outputs are attached. So, `bbb: ddd eee` means that device
`bbb` has two outputs, one leading to device `ddd` and the other leading
to device `eee`.

The Elves are pretty sure that the issue isn\'t due to any specific
device, but rather that the issue is triggered by data following some
specific *path* through the devices. Data only ever flows from a device
through its outputs; it can\'t flow backwards.

After dividing up the work, the Elves would like you to focus on the
devices starting with the one next to you (an Elf hastily attaches a
label which just says *`you`*) and ending with the main output to the
reactor (which is the device with the label *`out`*).

To help the Elves figure out which path is causing the issue, they need
you to find *every* path from `you` to `out`.

In this example, these are all of the paths from `you` to `out`:

- Data could take the connection from `you` to `bbb`, then from `bbb` to
  `ddd`, then from `ddd` to `ggg`, then from `ggg` to `out`.
- Data could take the connection to `bbb`, then to `eee`, then to `out`.
- Data could go to `ccc`, then `ddd`, then `ggg`, then `out`.
- Data could go to `ccc`, then `eee`, then `out`.
- Data could go to `ccc`, then `fff`, then `out`.

In total, there are *`5`* different paths leading from `you` to `out`.

*How many different paths lead from `you` to `out`?*
